## Downloading the ISO
First things first, we need to download the ISO file for Linux Mint. You can download it from [here](https://linuxmint.com/download.php).

Then click on the `Download` button for cinnamon as thats what we will be using today.
Then scroll down to the mirrors section and click on which link you would like to download from.

## Setting up the USB

To install linux mint you will need to flash it to a USB drive. You can use [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to do this. Download the software and install it.

I will not be doing this since im going to run it in a VM.

## Opening flashed linux mint

Once you have flashed the USB, plug it into your computer and boot into the USB. You can do this by pressing the boot menu key on your computer. This is usually `F12` or `ESC` otherwise you can find your correct key [here](https://www.wikihow.com/Enter-BIOS)

## Booting linux mint
When you boot into the USB you will be greeted with this screen.

You will want to click enter on `Start Linux Mint` if that does not work you can try `Start Linux Mint (compatibility mode)`

Then linux mint will boot into the live iso version where we can test it out before installing it.
You may test it if you want but i will be moving on to the installation.

Once its fully done booting your screen should look like this.

You will want to click on the `Install Linux Mint` icon on the desktop.

Then a window will popup with the installation process.

## Installing linux mint
The first screen should like similar to this.

if you would like to use a diffrent language you should select it. I will be using english for this tutorial.

Then click continue.

Same steps above for the keyboard layout.

Then you should be greeted to install multimedia codecs which you should do.

Then it will take a second to install the required drivers for ubuntu. 

Then the most important step of where it will be installing the disk.
For this tutorial im on a VM so i will be letting it erase itself and install linux mint on the disk.
If you have windows already installed it should give you the option to install linux mint alongside windows.

Then after you confirm the popup it will ask for a timezone & then finally ask for your name, computer name, username, and password.

it should look something like above (filled out form).

Then it will start installing linux mint on your computer. This step will take a while.
Once its done it will ask you to restart your computer.
